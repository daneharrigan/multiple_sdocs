h1. Multiple SDocs

If you're not familiar with "SDoc":http://github.com/voloko/sdoc, I find it absolutely awesome. You can get it from one of the following sources:

* "Github":http://github.com/voloko/sdoc
* "RubyGems":http://rubygems.org/gems/sdoc

h3. SDoc is sweet, but what is this?

This is a simple index to view SDoc output from multiple gems.

h3. How do I use it?

Great question! You can use this code with the following steps:

1. Clone this repository (@git clone git://github.com/daneharrigan/multiple_sdocs.git@)
2. Move your SDoc's into the @multiple_sdocs@ directory as the name of the gem (@mv thread_so_safe/rdoc multiple_sdocs/thread_so_safe@)
3. Update your @config.json@ file in the @multiple_sdocs@ directory
4. Put @multiple_sdocs@ where ever you'd like (in my case "daneharrigan.github.com":http://daneharrigan.github.com)

h3. Assumptions

I'm assuming you're not scared of JSON. The config file is a JSON document:

<pre><code>
{
  "subdomain": "your-github-username",
  "repositories": ["doc-1","doc-2","doc-3"]
}
</code></pre>

This code assumes your gem source exists in your Github directory.
